## Problem Statement
Teachers always have to attend class. On some odd day, if they are absent, the university has to appoint their replacement for that duration. In this process workload on teachers is increasing day by day, and universities also have to pay extra money for the same. So here we are with the machine learning model, which is encrypted with the teacherâ€™s voice, and the teacher can upload their content here.
So that it will explain the whole content to the student for a flexible duration. The text conversion module offers three functionalities as 

Personalization: allow users to create and save personalized voice profiles.
Batch processing: implement the ability to process a large number of texts in one go.
Online/offline mode: offer both online and offline modes.

The task of the teacher here is to upload content here and they just have to mention their time duration here, so it will explain the whole content for that duration.
